# retinal-vessel-segmentation

## Project name

In this paper, the code of the retinal vessel segmentation algorithm based on the divergence of the Cake filter

## Requirements

matlab（9.6.0.1072779 (R2019a)）

## Usage

### 1.Enter the catalog

Enter the directory code, 

find the main program test, 

test_drive and test_stare are the test drive data set and stare data set respectively.

Will output the segmented picture and the sensitivity, accuracy and specificity information.


### 2.dataset

 We use the DRIVE data set and STARE data set publicly available on the Internet as the test data set
 
## test

 1. Modify the address of the database in the test_drive.m  and test_stare.m file
 2. Create a new table
 3. Run the code, see the sensitivity, accuracy and specificity in the table
